[Combat Maneuvers](./combat_maneuver_example.md) with individual units, 
providing insights into the workings of the combat maneuver and behavior system in `ares-sc2`.

## Why Opt for Unit Squads and Group Behaviors?

 - Enable a squadron of units to function cohesively as a group, rather than as 
individual units lacking consideration for the collective strength in the face of nearby enemies.
 - Gain visibility into the spatial distribution of our units; recognizing scenarios 
where our main squad may have fewer units than smaller squads moving across the map. 
This insight could prompt strategic decisions such as pulling back to allow units to converge.
 - Embrace the concept of group thinking within a squad, unlocking the potential for 
human-like control, where all units respond to a single, coordinated action.
