Dealing with production logic for a bot often means wrestling with the same old repetitive code headaches. 
Imagine starting off with a bot geared towards a stalker and immortal combo, finely tuning your logic around
that. Now, say you want to shake things up and switch to a late-game skytoss setup â€“ suddenly, you're 
stuck adding more code for production facilities, tech structures, and handling those late-game units.

We get it, this kind of redundancy is a pain. We didn't just 
want to make transitioning between army compositions smoother; we wanted to kick out all that extra, 
unnecessary code clutter. Whether you're rocking a stalker and immortal crew or going all-in on a late-game 
skytoss spectacle, our approach offers a more straightforward and adaptable development process.

Furthermore, this system is split into two main behaviors, the `SpawnController` to manage army production,
and `ProductionController` to add production and tech up. Depending on your needs you can use one, both or
none at all!

## Defining army compositions
Both controllers rely on an army composition dictionary, for example:
```python
from sc2.ids.unit_typeid import UnitTypeId as UnitID

@property
def viking_tank(self) -> dict:
    return {
        UnitID.MARINE: {"proportion": 0.69, "priority": 4},
        UnitID.SIEGETANK: {"proportion": 0.13, "priority": 0},
        UnitID.VIKINGFIGHTER: {"proportion": 0.16, "priority": 3},
        UnitID.RAVEN: {"proportion": 0.02, "priority": 1},
    }

```
Things to note:

 - The `proportion` values should add up to 1.0 (0.69 + 0.13 + 0.16 + 0.02 = 1.0)
 - Each declared unit should be given a priority, where 0 is the highest. This allows resources
to be saved for important units.

## Running the controllers
Let's create a simple bot, demonstrating how to run these controllers.
```python
from ares import AresBot
from ares.behaviors.macro import ProductionController, SpawnController

from sc2.ids.unit_typeid import UnitTypeId as UnitID

class TestBot(AresBot):
    
    @property
    def viking_tank(self) -> dict:
        return {
            UnitID.MARINE: {"proportion": 0.69, "priority": 4},
            UnitID.SIEGETANK: {"proportion": 0.13, "priority": 0},
            UnitID.VIKINGFIGHTER: {"proportion": 0.16, "priority": 3},
            UnitID.RAVEN: {"proportion": 0.02, "priority": 1},
        }

    async def on_step(self, iteration: int) -> None:
        await super(TestBot, self).on_step(iteration)
        
        production_location = self.start_location
        
        # production controller
        self.register_behavior(
            ProductionController(self.viking_tank, production_location)
        )
        
        # spawn controller
        self.register_behavior(
            SpawnController(self.viking_tank)
        )
```

These behaviors can be further customized through arguments,
