    Especially combined with `Mining` and ares built in placement solver.

    Example:
    ```py
    from ares.behaviors.macro import UpgradeCCs

    self.register_behavior(
        UpgradeCCs(to=UnitTypeId.ORBITALCOMMAND, prioritize=True)
    )

        to: The structure type we want to build.
        prioritize: If True and there is a CC waiting to upgrade, but
            we can't afford it yet, this behavior will return True
            This is useful in a MacroPlan as it will prevent other
            spending actions occurring.
            Default is True
